## What is SICP?

Structure and Interpreation of Computer Programs is a textbook written by Hal Abelson that originally accompanied an introductory course in electrical engineering at MIT.

It is a highly respected book that teaches many (if not all) of the fundamental conecpts of computer programming such as:
* Recursion
* Abstraction
* Modularity
* Programming Language
	* Design
	* Implementation

Although SICP courses have adopted the use of Python, I've chosen to stick with the Scheme dialect of LISP (LISt Processing).

This repository is mainly for the purpose of note-taking so I'm not sure how organized I will keep it, but I will aim to keep it as tidy as possible.
